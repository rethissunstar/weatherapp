This is an app that will tell me the next 5 days of weather - let it be more accurate than the weather network.

The search is comprehensive you can specify london,CA by following that format. 

## Credits
me.  I struggled with this.  Not throwing the tutor under the bus.  I opened the site and the response came back in the wrong order.  You will see the geolocation data did not return anything in the second set.
I followed the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSTn6dseNEc for code using ajax as fetch request wasn't working.
