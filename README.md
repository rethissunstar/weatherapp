# weatherapp
This is an app that will tell me the next 5 days of weather - let it be more accurate than the weather network.

## Installation/use
by going to the website it will bring up Toronto's weather.  It was to be for other cities but the cors error that makes the API not usable unless you sign up for the non-free version requires the use of a second API and no data is coming from that geolocation api. 

## Credits
me.  I struggled with this.  Not throwing the tutor under the bus.  I opened the site and the response came back in the wrong order.  You will see the geolocation data did not return anything in the second set.
